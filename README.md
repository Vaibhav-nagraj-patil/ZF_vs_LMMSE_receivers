This repository contains a simulation of a MIMO communication system that compares the performance of Zero-Forcing (ZF) and Linear Minimum Mean Square Error (LMMSE) receivers using Binary Phase-Shift Keying (BPSK) modulation. The code is implemented in both MATLAB and Python, and it evaluates the Bit Error Rate (BER) across a range of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) values. The simulation demonstrates how each receiver handles interference and noise in a MIMO setup, providing insights into receiver performance in wireless systems.
